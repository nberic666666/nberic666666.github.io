<p> How is AI used? Artificial intelligence is being used in hundreds of ways all around us. It has changed our world and made our lives more convenient and interesting. Some of the many uses of AI you may know include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voice recognition</strong>. Most people know to call out for Siri when they need directions, or to ask their smart home Alexa to set a timer. This technology is a form of artificial intelligence. Machine learning helps Siri, Alexa, and other voice recognition devices learn about you and your preferences, helping it know how to help you. These tools also utilize artificial intelligence to pull in answers to your questions or perform the tasks you ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Self-driving cars</strong>. Machine learning and visual recognition are used in autonomous vehicles to help the car understand its surroundings and be able to react accordingly. Facial recognition and biometric systems help self-driving cars recognize people and keep them safe. These cars can learn and adapt to traffic patterns, signs, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chatbots. </strong>Many companies are utilizing artificial intelligence to strengthen their customer service teams. Chatbots can interact with customers and answer generic questions without needing to use a real human’s time. They can learn and adapt to certain responses, get more information to help them produce a different output, and more. A certain word can trigger them to put out a certain definition as a response. This expert system can give a human-level of interaction to customers. Online shopping.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Online shopping</strong> systems utilize algorithms to learn more about your preferences and predict what you’ll want to shop for. They can then put those items right in front of you, helping them grab your attention quickly. Amazon and other retailers are constantly working their algorithms to learn more about you and what you might buy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it’s one thing to know what AI is, it’s another to understand the underlying functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Artificial intelligence operates by processing data through advanced algorithms. It combs large data sets with its algorithms, learning from the patterns or features in the data. There are many theories and subfields in AI systems including: Machine learning. Machine learning uses neural networks to find hidden insights from data, without being programmed for what to look for or what to conclude. Machine learning is a common way for programs to find patterns and increase their intelligence over time. Deep learning. Deep learning utilizes huge neural networks with many layers, taking advantage of its size to process huge amounts of data with complex patterns. Deep learning is an element of machine learning, just with larger data sets and more layers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cognitive computing. Cognitive computing has a goal for a human-like interaction with machines. Think robots that can see and hear, and then respond as a human would. Computer vision. In AI, computer vision utilizes pattern recognition and deep learning to understand a picture or video. This means the machine can look around and take pictures or videos in real time, and interpret the surroundings. The overall goal of AI is to make software that can learn about an input, and explain a result with its output. Artificial intelligence gives human-like interactions, but won’t be replacing humans anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
