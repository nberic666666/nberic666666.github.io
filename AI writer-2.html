<p> The time has come, the Walrus said,
  To talk of many things:
  Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—
  Of cabbages—and kings—
  And why the sea is boiling hot—
  And whether pigs have wings.&nbsp;</p>

<strong> &nbsp;Analysis:	
  Basically,the poem indicates the truth of the world. 
  Even though we can not understand the poem very well, however I have the brave heart to discover the author's inner world.&nbsp;</strong>
